                            Vaccinations have been a hot topic of conversation for some time now, but we don’t only need to worry about protecting the human population from dangerous and potentially deadly diseases. Dogs, cats, and other animals can be just as likely to catch viruses and other transmissible diseases, many of which can prove fatal. Pet vaccinations work in the same way as human vaccines – by preparing your pet’s body to recognize and fight specific harmful bacteria or viruses. Vaccines can significantly reduce or completely prevent symptoms and effects of some of the diseases that our animals come into contact with. They are usually provided on a regular schedule since their effectiveness doesn’t necessarily last forever.

                            Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease which infects domestic and wild animals. It is transmitted to other animals and humans through close contact with saliva from infected animals (i.e., bites, scratches, licks on broken skin, and mucous membranes). Once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal to both animals and humans. Rabies differs from many other infections in that the development of clinical disease can be prevented through timely immunization even after exposure to the infecting agent. The rabies vaccine is an altered or inactive version of the virus, which invokes an immune response in your pet and creates antibodies that fight the disease. Your pet’s immune response to the vaccine deteriorates over time, and your pet needs multiple doses throughout their lives to protect them from the disease. Vets usually advise dogs and cats to receive booster doses every year or every three years, depending on the vaccine.

                        This is a simple blood test that provides information about the different cell types in the blood. These include red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues; white blood cells, which fight infection and respond to inflammation; and platelets, which help the blood to clot.
                        The CBC provides details about the number, size, and shape of the various cell types and identifies the presence of abnormal cells in circulation. See handout "Complete Blood Count" for further information. <br />
                        A small sample of blood is collected into a special tube that prevents the blood from clotting. The sample is then put in a machine called an automated blood analyzer, which counts the different cell types and describes various characteristics of the cells. In addition, a drop of blood is spread thinly on a glass slide, creating a blood smear. This smear is stained with special dyes and examined under the microscope to look at the appearance of individual cells. The blood smear is assessed by a trained technician or veterinarian and may be sent to a pathologist for review if the cells are abnormal.
